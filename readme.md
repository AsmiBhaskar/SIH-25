## Contribution & Workflow Rules

1. **Fork First:** Before contributing, create a fork of the repository to your own GitHub account.

2. **Sync Regularly:** Always sync your fork with the upstream (main) repository before starting any new work. This ensures you are working with the latest codebase.

3. **Branching:** Create a new branch in your fork for each feature, bugfix, or change. Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/login-api`, `fix/typo-readme`).

4. **Commits:**
	- Write clear, concise commit messages describing your changes.
	- Group related changes into a single commit when possible.
	- Avoid committing generated files, secrets, or environment-specific configs.

5. **Pull Requests (PRs):**
	- Open a PR from your fork's branch to the main repository's `main` branch.
	- Ensure your PR is up-to-date with the latest upstream changes before submitting.
	- Provide a clear description of what your PR does and reference related issues if applicable.
	- Address review comments promptly and keep discussions constructive.

6. **Code Review:**
	- All PRs require at least one approval before merging.
	- Respond to requested changes and suggestions.

7. **Testing:**
	- Test your changes locally before pushing.
	- Ensure all existing and new tests pass.

8. **Documentation:**
	- Update documentation as needed for any new features or changes.

9. **Respect Project Structure:**
	- Follow the established folder and file organization.
	- Do not make breaking changes without prior discussion.

10. **Communication:**
	- Use issues and PR comments for questions, suggestions, and bug reports.
	- Be respectful and collaborative.
